# Algorithm-Competition-Practice

## Algorithm Competition Preparation - Starting from October 24th, 2023.
1. During university, solve at least one to two LeetCode Medium problems daily (primarily using Python, occasionally using Java, C, C++)
2. Pick one algorithm or data structure topic each week to learn, and store the learning code in /Learning
3. Participate in a LeetCode weekly contest every one to two weeks, and record the scores, problem-solving process, and make-up problems (refers to solving the problems that were not completed during the contest)
4. Irregularly pick an APCS or other certification, competition to do timed problem-solving, and record the scores, problem-solving process, and make-up problems (refers to solving the problems that were not completed during the contest)
